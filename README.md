## About
YT Worldtrends is a single-page web app facilitating the exploration of trending video content across the globe.

Worldtrends was built as my CS701 senior project at Middlebury College, and was my first foray in web development. 

The functionality of the site straightforward; select a country to explore
top trending videos sourced from youtube for that region; dynamically updates content. Fairly interesting to 
adventurously click around the world map. Try it out! There's some illuminating content out there :)

Maybe I can clean up the code some day, because the app is kind of fun...
