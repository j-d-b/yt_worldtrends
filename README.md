# YT Worldtrends
YT Worldtrends is a single-page web app facilitating the exploration of trending video content across the globe.

## Preface 
Worldtrends was built in early 2017 as my CS701 senior project at Middlebury College. It was my first foray in web development. I didn't know anything when I started this, and the code is a true mess: a single JS file, a strange mix of ES6 and older syntax, and no build process or package manager... etc. 

I've archived this repo but left it up here because *the project and app itself are interesting* and *it's fun to look back on*. 

I'm sure at some point the YouTube API will change, and at that point, the project will be ðŸ‘‹.

## About/Usage
The functionality of the site is straightforward: select a country to explore the top trending videos sourced from youtube for that region. Video content is updated dynamically. 

It's surprisingly interesting to adventurously click around the world map. Try it out! There's some illuminating content out there :)
