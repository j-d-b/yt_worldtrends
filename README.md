# yt_worldtrends
YT WorldTrends is an attempt at a single-page web app facilitating the exploration of trending video content across the globe.

Priority for this project was placed UI design. The functionality of the site straightforward; select a country to explore
top trending videos sourced from youtube for that region; dynamically updates content. Fairly interesting to 
adventurously click around the world map. Try it out! There's some illuminating content out there :)
